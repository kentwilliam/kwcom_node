There used to be a few posts here about React and digital project work. However, today is a good day to clean house and start over. That's what this is.

I hope to make this space a “home page” in the old-school sense: an eclictic collection of low-threshold public writing about my interests.

In other words: Expect musings on user experience design, videogames, technology, books, music and so on. The usual stuff.

I'll get my RSS feed back up in a bit.
