# The road that led me here

In the near future, this will hopefully become a useful repository for thoughts on interaction design and web engineering.

However, before we can get started, here's a quick bit about who I am.

In brief, I'm into UX, web technologies and videogames—in no particular order. 

Currently I'm enjoying my work at [m›PATH](http://www.mpath.com) exploring a React.js/CoffeeScript and Ruby/Sinatra tech stack as well as a host of complex UX problems.

Previously, I worked for [Fan TV](http://www.fan.tv) doing web development and UX design for their cutting-edge web app and backend tools.

I also worked as a UI designer at Disney Interactive on Facebook-based social games like [Threads of Mystery](http://www.insidesocialgames.com/2012/08/17/threads-of-mystery-review/) and [World Series of Poker](http://www.wsop.com/news/2010/Jul/3017/WSOP-FACEBOOK-POKER-GAME-AVAILABLE-NOW.html).

I have a Master's degree in Computer Science with specialization in interaction design from the University of Oslo. For [my thesis](https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/10115), I designed and implemented a prototype “videogame for women” and learnt a lot about the ways this kind of gender-driven design can be problematized.
