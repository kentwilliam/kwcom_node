I'm really fed up with Apple.

But perhaps more so than this, I'm tired of computing in general getting so incredibly stagnant. 10 years ago, Apple showed the way forward. They released a series of Macbook Pros that were so good, that if they hadn't made them intentionally bad, they would still be good.

I bought one of those. And man, did I love it.

Since then, macOS has seen *very* little development, despite all the obvious opportunities ahead. It ... it seems that Apple thinks that the desktop operating system is, essentially, finished, and all that remains is to make it harder to install and use software that hasn't gotten a shiny stamp of approval from Cupertino, and to continue to force developers who want to target iOS and macOS to use at least one Apple computer.

Touch input is just the start, although iPad seems to have no interest in becoming a real computer with real affordances for professional digital experience creators. I understand why this is, of course. Apple doesn't want to backslide into the integrity problems that come with the Posix model.

What are the opportunities I speak of?
- Touch based interface evolution - touch bar was the beginning of the right idea, botched
- LTE computing
- Better data processing and file management
- Standards for extending 'creative tooling' past mouse + keyboard with a standardized platform, not just experiments
- Large touch screens
- Better user control across local and cloud systems
- Better cross app file systems and meaning-creation
- Better photo, video, and digital legacy management
- Social infrastructure

But you just can't have it both ways. Either the iPad is the future of cumputing, in which case Apple needs to *really* speed up this transition in a big way, or it's ... not, in which case I'm left to wonder what's going on.

In the meantime, of course, Microsoft has been doing what they do best ... and patiently made their crappy software a lot better. WSL is a huge example.

But even Microsoft, as prescient as they can be with stuff like Xbox Game pass, Kinect, and the Hololens, does not really seem to be interested in exploring the future of personal computing UX

...

more on this.

then, more on the hurdles of getting back into Windows. Something.
